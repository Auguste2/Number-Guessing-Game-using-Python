How the Game Works
Choose Difficulty Level: At the start of the game, you will be asked to choose a difficulty level:

Easy: Number range 1–10, 5 attempts.
Medium: Number range 1–50, 7 attempts.
Hard: Number range 1–100, 10 attempts.
Guess the Number: The game generates a random number within the selected range. You have a set number of attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game will tell you if the number is too high, too low, or correct.

Feedback: The game provides feedback after each guess:

Too low: Your guess is smaller than the target number.
Too high: Your guess is larger than the target number.
Correct: You guessed the right number.
Game Over: If you guess the number correctly, you win. If you run out of attempts without guessing correctly, the game will reveal the correct number.

Play Again: After the game ends, you can choose to play again by typing y or quit by typing n.
